# The Outline of the project

## A general Analysis of the Soccer Players and Leagues

Basically this project is focusing on the how to let audience have general knowledge about the soccer world.We have a dataset 
for individual palyers data, we can generate insightful introduction about the soccer world by visualization the individual 
soccer players data and the distribution of top players in the different.So eventually audience would have known which player or 
league would have great competitiveness.


## Incentive and main goal of this project:

This project have two main goals, let the audience have general knowledge of the soccer world and know how money drives the soccer industry.We would not have thorough industrial analysis on this relationship, yet we can tell from the data visualization that better players are more valued, and more budget or more financial support is more competitive for a league.This is a two-way causal realtionship and here starts the story.

One important clue for this analytic story is money.  The monetary value of individual player, the money each league spend on the team building and transfering, are great support or good reflection of the competitiveness of these entities.
 
Eventually we are going to generate insightful analysis about how money or value relates to all factors in this industry and the predictive trend in terms of our conclusion in competitiveness analysis of each entity in this soccer world, players, teams or leagues.

From a shallow point that we want to probe into the soccer world, to have a quick review of who are the best ones and outstanding in this industry, simply looking at the most expensive players.Seeing the graph of the individual value ranking we have general knowledge of the top players list : Ronaldo , Messi ,Neymar  .... these are supporting material we can conclude that as they show up in different ranking.

As we want to have more insightful knowledge about what value individuals can output in terms of soccer profession, here is some good graphs to generate insights.
 
So after giving a general introduction about the soccer world we would probe into the relationship between financial factor and the technical 
competitiveness.

## Audience feedback

Yes this is a very abstract topic, I try to introduce a general view of the soccer world and also let them know about the performance of soccer is related to the money,which is the two main goals in this project.
1.It is hard to make it thorough, the interviewee would say they still would feel to be in a intriductory story rather than a insightful story.So I think more direct charts to show the second topic would be better.
2. Charts looks good, logic is clear.
3. More information needed to show that competiveness relates to the money.
4. I have touched something in-depth that is worthing spending more energy on , so maybe some articles about sports business and 
the global market analysis in soccer industry would be helpful.

## Structure of the Projects

First part of the data visualization would talk about some key ranking for individual players in the soccer world nowadays,
measuring the metrics like goals, market value, and some data presenting technical performance.This part aims to talk about
the individual competitiveness of soccer players so to give a quick introduction for people who barely knows about the soccer
world.

Second part of the data visualization would talk about the distribution of top players in different leagues, 
in terms of market value, number of top scorers.And also the aggregated data visualization would be presented.
This part aims to tell audience about the general competitiveness of each league in the world.


First Part : Individual Soccer Player Report

I.
Visualization about some key metrics for individual players in the soccer areas, providing insights from key metrics like goals, 
personal market value and technical measurements.



II.
This part aims to lead the audience into a first glimpse of the soccer world and present a basic introduction of the individual players 
in out time. Also it would raise the topic about the relationship between monetary factor and the technical performance.


Second Part:

I.
The second part would further discuss about the competitiveness of each leagues in the soccer industry, and derive the statistics from the 
part I about the individuality, to show the distribution of the top players, and relevant information about the monetary analysis of the soccer industry.
This part would include : Visualization about the competitiveness of each league in the world, relating to the soccer players distribution, total goals and total transfer value accumulated.


II.
This part aims to give audience insights about the general popularity and competitiveness of each soccer league and have a 
basic knowledge of the situation in the soccer world.


## Findings and Summary:

(1)
From the visualization we can generally know who are the best ones:
Messi , Ronaldo , De Bruyne .... by observing the charts in terms of their market value and technical competiveness, so to firstly get the simple relationship
between market value and athletic competiveness.

(2)
And in the scope of the leagues, we can derive more insights about which are the best leagues, Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga,
and Serie A. They are obviously dominant in the ranking of technical charts and also the financial reports.
So part II fruther generate insights about the relationship between monetary factor 
and competitiveness of each league.

So to eventually, naively and trivially have conclusion from the context in this story:

Fiancial back-up are the power of the better technical performance and conversely the better technical performance would promote a player, 
a team, and a league into a more valuable one.
