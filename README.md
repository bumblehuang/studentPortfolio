This is a personal portfolio for Junfeng Huang for telling stories of Data course in CMU  

# About Me
I am Huang Junfeng, a  master student from MISM in Heinz College and this is my second year. I have experience in software engineering by doing a lof of projects ranging from cloud computing, distributed system and web application.As for data, I did have done some practical projects to process large dataset and ETL into backend, and also some machine learning projects which requires me to transform data and classify them.Yet how to interpret data after processing is also important, which make the telling stories of data so valuable and important. 


# What I hope to learn
I hope to generate insights from the data by learning some more abstract methodology to interpret data and this is hard to achieving some rigid rules, so telling stories with data course would be more flexible in this manner as it can provide some "Out-Of_Scope" insights for anyone who try to know insights from the data.Also I hope I can learn some practical knowledge in using visualization tool like WEKA or tableau.
